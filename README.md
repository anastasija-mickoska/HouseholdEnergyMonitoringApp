This project, developed as part of a bachelor thesis, is a mobile application for tracking household electricity consumption, built with React Native on the frontend and a Node.js + Express backend hosted on Google Cloud App Engine. It integrates Firebase Authentication for user management and Firebase Firestore for storing electricity meter usages and appliance usages, limits, and notifications. The app enables users to log consumption data, view daily, weekly and monthly reports, set consumption limits, receive notifications when approaching or exceeding thresholds, and receive reminders to log electricity meter data using REST API requests for communication between the app and backend.
